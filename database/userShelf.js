    reviewText: `It has been a long 12 years that every fan was waiting for this very moment - the return of John Frusciante into the Red Hot Chili Peppers. They are back, the original crew and they are better than ever. 
    I can easily say my favorite band in the world are the Red Hot Chili Peppers, so it will be very hard to be objective about this review - but here we go. As I said, I am one of the biggest fans, but, I have to say, I wasn’t very impressed by the albums they released with Josh Klinghoffer. I’m with you and The Getaway just didn’t feel like they were coming from the same band. They were good music, still better than most of the shit that is released today, but they were missing something that is very crucial to this band - John Frusicante. His guitar, his chemistry with the rest of them and just his presence, make this band a whole different machine. To paint a better picture for people who are not big fans of the band: imagine your mom leaves, and she is replaced by a step mom who is just ok. But then mom comes back. Anthony, Flea, John and Chad are a family, and that’s one thing that makes them the musicians they are. They love each other, care for each other and are each other's soulmates. That’s what this new album is about. Their love, friendship, their love for music and art, and generally, about love. 
    As of writing this, I listened to the album about 3 times. On my first listen, I was very anxious that I won’t enjoy it, because the whole community was extremely positive about the album, and I was a bit skeptical and I thought they were overhyping it. BUT, FUCK I WAS WRONG. The whole album felt like an emotional roller coaster. Some songs brought a huge smile to my face, some tears of joy, some just plain tears of sadness. These songs have some of the best lyrics they have ever written. Musically, the band has never sounded better. The chemistry between them never stopped after Stadium Arcadium, and it evolved even more, to what feels like a very mature sound. If I could describe this album, I would say its an evolution of their sound, merging all of their styles, from Blood Sugar Sex Magik, Californication, but mostly from By The Way and Stadium Arcadium. It’s like a baby with 4 parents, which got all the best parts of the parents. Amazing guitar, vocals, bass, drums, and they even went back to the trumpet!
    This might be very subjective, but every song on this album is either great or amazing. There is no bad or skippable song. They all blend in very well with each other and, like Stadium Arcadium, it’s an album I can listen to from the beginning to the end. Songs that stood out for me, and I would rate a 9-10/10 are Here Ever After, She’s a Lover, White Braids & Pillow Chairs, Aquatic Mouth Dance, Heavy Wing, Tangelo, Let Em Cry, The Great Apes, Whatchu Thinkin and Bastards of Light. 
    As a guitarist myself, I felt every John's tone, his beautiful licks, backing vocals, solos. He is truly one of the best guitarists alive and a wonderful human being. 
    To cite my fathers words (who is by the way a long time fan, every since Mothers Milk) when I played Aquatic Mouth Dance to him: “The fucking Red Hot Chili Peppers are fucking back” . I couldn’t be happier that these guys are back together, I couldn’t be happier for this album. I was very empty musically and emotionally in the past 3-4 years, because there was nothing for me to connect to. I haven’t been playing the guitar as often as I used to. These songs restored me in a way, made me feel stuff I haven’t felt in a long time and they made me pick up the guitar again, learning Here Ever After, for the beginning. Thank you, Anthony, Flea, John and Chad for this amazing album, for these amazing songs. I am sending Unlimited Love to all of you, to all the fans. See you in Budapest!
